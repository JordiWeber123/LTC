# Listing Title Categorizer (LTC)
LTC is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to recognize titles in online store listings (such as Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba,) and put them into a set of predefined categories.

The purpose of creating this tool is for users and companies to be able to quickly understand how different, inconsistent listing styles and names can relate to one another and be sold as part of a greater category (i.e. Tech, Apparel, Cosmetics, etc.)
